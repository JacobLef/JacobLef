# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Computer Science sophomore** at Northeastern University pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a **Software Concentration**, 
planning to continue with a **Master's in Software Engineering Systems**. I'm passionate about building robust backend infrastructure, 
diving deep into database internals, and architecting scalable cloud systems. Currently exploring the intersection of **systems programming** 
and **distributed computing** while developing a strong foundation in software engineering principles.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Java, TypeScript (T3 stack, React, Prisma, gRPC), Python
- **Focus Areas:** Database engines, system design, cloud and network engineering/architecture.
- **Tools:** Docker, Git, Nvim/Vim, VSCode

## ðŸš€ What I'm Building
Currently working on a **custom relational database engine** built from scratch in Java, featuring:
- Custom B+ Tree implementation for efficient data storage
- Banking application with multi-user support
- Docker containerization and clean MVC architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Backend-focused full-stack development
- Network software engineering
- Cloud architecture and scalable systems

## ðŸ“« Let's Connect
Always interested in discussing databases, system design, and software architecture!
